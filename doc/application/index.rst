Applications
============

Otfmi bridges the physics of the model (in `FMI <https://fmi-standard.org/>`__ format) with the universe of
`OpenTURNS <http://openturns.github.io/openturns/master/contents.html>`__ probabilistic analyses.

In the following applications, advanced computer experiments are performed on the FMUs.

.. note::
   | Here we demonstrate the potential of using OpenTURNS on FMUs.  
   | For easier examples, see the section :doc:`Examples<../example/index>`.
