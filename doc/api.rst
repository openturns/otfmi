API documentation
=================

Otfmi facilitates the analysis of FMUs **at a given time step and/or
over time** (*static* versus *dynamic* analyses).

Static analysis
---------------


The class **FMUFunction** wraps the FMU in an :py:class:`openturns.Function`. Its output corresponds to the
FMU’s output at its last simulation time. When the FMU is static (i.e. its output is time-independent), the value of the last simulation time is indifferent.

       FMUFunction

Its lower-level counterpart is **OpenTURNSFMUFunction**, closer to PyFMI’s methods but not directly usable with OpenTURNS.

   OpenTURNSFMUFunction

Dynamic analysis
----------------

The class **FMUPointToFieldFunction** wraps the FMU in an :py:class:`openturns.PointToFieldFunction`. Its output is a :py:class:`openturns.Field` gathering the outputs as function of time.

   FMUPointToFieldFunction

Its lower-level counterpart is **OpenTURNSFMUPointToFieldFunction**, closer to PyFMI’s methods but not directly usable with OpenTURNS.

   :toctree: _generated/
   :template: class.rst_t

   OpenTURNSFMUPointToFieldFunction

Common low-level functions
--------------------------

The submodule **otfmi.fmi** gathers a set of useful functions, employed by the (higher-level) classes mentionned above.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _generated/fmi/

   fmi.load_fmu
   fmi.simulate
   fmi.parse_kwargs_simulate
   fmi.apply_initialization_script
   fmi.get_name_variable
   fmi.get_causality_str
   fmi.get_variability
   fmi.get_fixed_value
   fmi.get_start_value
   fmi.set_dict_value

From OpenTURNS to FMU
---------------------

Otfmi can also embed an OpenTURNS function in a Modelica model and/or FMU.
