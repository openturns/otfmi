Initialize FMUFunction
======================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 14-17

The interest of using FMUs in Python lies in the ease to change its input
/ parameter values. This notably enables to study the behavior of the FMU
with uncertain inputs / parameters.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 19-24

Initialization scripts can gather a large number of initial values.
The use of initialization scripts (*.mos* files) is common in Dymola :

- to save the value of all the variables of a model after simulation,
- to restart simulation from a given point.

First, retrieve the path to the FMU *deviation.fmu*.
Recall the deviation model is static, i.e. its output does not evolve over
time.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 32-38

.. code-block:: default


    import otfmi.example.utility
    import otfmi
    path_fmu = otfmi.example.utility.get_path_fmu("deviation")









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 39-41

The initialization script must be provided to `FMUFunction` constructor.
We thus create it now (using Python for clarity).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-45

.. note::
   The initialization script can be automatically created in Dymola.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 45-51

.. code-block:: default

 
    temporary_file = "initialization.mos"
    with open(temporary_file, "w") as f:
        f.write("L = 300;\n")
        f.write("F = 25000;\n")








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-54

If no initial value is provided for an input / parameter, it is set to its
default initial value (as set in the FMU).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 56-59

We can now build the `FMUFunction`. In the example below, we use the
initialization script to fix the values of ``L`` and ``F`` in the FMU whereas
``E`` and `ÃŒ` are the function variables.

    import openturns as ot

    function = otfmi.FMUFunction(
        path_fmu,
        inputs_fmu=["E", "I"],
        outputs_fmu=["y"],
        initialization_script=abspath("initialization.mos"))

    inputPoint = ot.Point([2e9, 7e7])
    outputPoint = function(inputPoint)
    print(outputPoint)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 74-78

.. note::
   It is possible to set the value of a  model input in the
   initialization script *and* use it as a function input variable. In this
   case, the initial value from the initialization script is overriden.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 80-83

For instance, we consider the 4 model parameters as variables. Note the
result is different from above, as the input point overrides the values from
the initialization script.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 83-94

.. code-block:: default


    smallExampleFunction = otfmi.FMUFunction(
        path_fmu,
        inputs_fmu=["E", "F", "L", "I"],
        outputs_fmu=["y"],
        initialization_script=abspath("initialization.mos"))

    inputPoint = ot.Point([2e9, 2e4, 800, 7e7])

Come back to the function with 2 input variables defined above.
``F`` and ``L`` initial values are defined in the initialization script, and
remain constant over time. We can now set probability laws on the function
input variables ``E`` and ``I`` to propagate their uncertainty through the
model:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 100-112

.. code-block:: default


    lawE = ot.Uniform(65e9, 75e9)
    lawI = ot.Uniform(1.3e7, 1.7e7)
    dist = ot.ComposedDistribution([lawE, lawI])
    inputSample = dist.getSample(10)

    outputSample = function(inputSample)

    import openturns.viewer as viewer
    graph = ot.HistogramFactory().build(outputSample).drawPDF()
    view = viewer.View(graph)
    view.ShowAll()
