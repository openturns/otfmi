`Persalys <https://persalys.fr/>`__ is a graphical user interface to some Otfmi and `OpenTURNS <http://openturns.github.io/openturns/master/contents.html>`__ methods. The software is free and can be downloaded `here <https://persalys.fr/obtenir.php?la=en">`__.

A parabolic solar collector concentrates the sun light on a tube via parabolic mirrors. A fluid (generally oil) circulates in this tube and heats up thanks to the reverberated sunlight.

We model this installation in Modelica using the
`ThermoSysPro <https://thermosyspro.com/>`__ component
`SolarCollector <https://thermosyspro.gitlab.io/documentation/src/Solar/Collectors/SolarCollector.html>`__.
The collector inputs (atmospheric temperature, sun radiation and sun incidence angle) are set to constant values. We collect the heat flow between the collector output and a source of constant temperature symbolizing an infinite oil flow in the tube.

This model is static, i.e. \ **its output does not depend on time**.

**Which input variable(s) influence the most the heat flow ?**

Sobol’ first-order indices quantify the proportion of the output variance explained by an input variable. As Sobol’ first-order indices for all input variables sum to 1, they provide a ranking of the input variables. The higher the index, the more influent the input variable.

We use Persalys to compute the Sobol’ indices for the three input variables : the atmospheric temperature ``T_atm.k``, ``angle_incidence.k``, ``radiation.k``.

The solar collector model is exported under the FMI standard 2.0 (Co-Simulation format) into *Solar.fmu*. We first load the FMU in Persalys v11.0.

To select the FMU in the files tree view, we click on the three dots at the right of the empty line. A new window opens, in which we select the FMU named *Solar.fmu*.

Once the FMU is loaded, all its variables (inputs, outputs, local quantities, etc) are displayed. We select the variables for the sensitivity analysis:

* output variable: ``heatFlow``,
* input variables: ``T_atm.k``, ``angle_incidence.k``, ``radiation.k``.

Now that the variables are set, Persalys ‘’tree of possibles’’ appears. The methods which can be used are colored in deep blue, whereas the methods with prerequisite steps appear with a forbidden pannel.

We can see that, before performing sensitivity analysis, we first have to set a probabilistic model. In other words, we have to set the probability distribution of the 3 input variables.

We consider the following laws for the input variables: - sun incidence
angle: normal law :math:`\mathcal{N}(30, 3)`. It corresponds to a fixed
time in the day (with the sun incidence angle varying slightly around
its nominal value). - sun radiation: truncated normal law
:math:`\mathcal{N}(70, 50)`. It corresponds to a standard sunlight,
varying depending on the weather. - atmospheric temperature: normal law
:math:`\mathcal{N}(300, 10)`. It corresponds to variations depending on
the season.

We select the Sobol’ indices as method for sensitivity analysis.

Sobol’ indices are displayed as a graph. The sun radiation is the
variable with the strongest influence on the output.

Keep in mind that the result relies on 2 assumptions:

* the input variables are independent,
* the input variables follow the probability distributions set here above.

`Analysis and reduction of models using
Persalys <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354810878_Analysis_and_reduction_of_models_using_Persalys>`__. In this paper, metamodeling (aka model reduction) is performed on the solar collector. The OpenTURNS metamodel is then inserted in a solar power plant model using
`FMUExporter </auto_example/ot_to_fmu/plot_model_exporter>`__.
