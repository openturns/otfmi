# Applications

Otfmi bridges the physics of the model (in [FMI](https://fmi-standard.org/) format) with the universe of [OpenTURNS](http://openturns.github.io/openturns/master/contents.html) probabilistic analyses.

In the following applications, advanced computer experiments are performed on the FMUs.

> Here we demonstrate the potential of using OpenTURNS on FMUs.
> For easier examples, see the section [Examples](../exemple/index.rst).
